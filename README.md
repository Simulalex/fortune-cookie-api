#Fortune cookie API
A simple rest API that returns a randomly selected fortune and an array of lucky numbers

##Why does something this dumb exist?
This project is just a simple example of a golang API that I'm using as part of a Kubernetes demo. I just need something simple to deploy in a cluster and quickly show that it works.
